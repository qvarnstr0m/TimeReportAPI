# TimeReportAPI
TimeReportAPI is an ASP.NET Core project built using Entity Framework Core. The API provides a time tracking solution, allowing users to manage Employees, Projects, and their related Time Reports.

## Project Overview
This project features a simple and clean architecture with the main components organized in a clear file structure.


## TimeReportClassLibrary
This class library is included in the solution and contains the data models (Entity classes) for the project:  

Employee.cs. 
Project.cs. 
ProjectEmployee.cs. 
TimeReport.cs. 
These classes are used to model and interact with data.  

## Controllers
There are three main controllers that handle various aspects of the system:

+ EmployeeController: Handles actions related to employees.
+ ProjectController: Handles actions related to projects.
+ TimeReportController: Handles actions related to time reports.  

Each of these controllers corresponds to a respective repository which handles the data operations for each entity.

## Repositories
The Repositories provide a layer of abstraction between the data access and the business logic of the application.  

The generic Repository.cs handles basic CRUD operations.  
The specific repositories (EmployeeRepository.cs, TimeReportRepository.cs, and ProjectRepository.cs) implement interfaces with additional methods that require unique queries specific to those entities.  

## DTOs
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used for sending data over the network and can help protect your data models, allowing you to control exactly what data is sent and received.  

## Security and Best Practices
+ The appsettings.json file with sensitive data such as connection strings is not published due to the usage of a .gitignore file.
+ Try/Catch blocks are used for error handling in Controller actions to handle any exceptions that could occur during execution.
+ The project uses the Repository pattern to separate the logic that retrieves the data and maps it to the entity model from the business logic that acts on the model.
+ Async/Await pattern is used for non-blocking database operations.

## Potential Limitations and Areas for Improvement
+ Error Handling: The current error handling approach in the application involves returning a generic error message for every exception. However, the specifics of an exception can be quite varied. Therefore, a more comprehensive and context-aware error handling mechanism might be more beneficial for both developers and users.

+ Logging: The application currently writes exceptions to the console. While this is useful during development, in a production environment it's better to log to a more permanent and easily accessible location, such as a file or a logging service. A robust logging system can help you troubleshoot and understand application behavior.

+ Validation: Currently, the application may lack comprehensive input validation, which might lead to unhandled exceptions or inaccurate data being stored in the database. Adding additional validation (for instance, ensuring that StartTime is always less than EndTime in a TimeReport) can improve the robustness of the application.

+ Testing: As of now, there is no mention of unit tests or integration tests in the application. Automated testing is a crucial aspect of maintaining code quality and preventing bugs as the application grows.

+ Authentication and Authorization: The current version of the API does not seem to have any authentication or authorization mechanisms in place. In a real-world application, you'd typically want to restrict access to certain endpoints to protect sensitive information.

## Conclusion
TimeReportAPI is a well-structured project that demonstrates a good understanding of .NET Core web API development, Entity Framework Core, and clean code principles. By continuing to build on this strong foundation, the application can be expanded to include more features and handle more complex scenarios.
